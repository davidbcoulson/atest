## Requirements
Davids Comments:  I am going to use React Material UI to accomplish this task quickly. 
- **Header**: Create a standard (can be non-functioning) header akin to other eCommerce pages, with a logo, search bar, and applicable icons. --done
- **Menu**: Create a standard menu (links do not need to work) for an eCommerce retail site.  -DONE
- **Footer**: Create a footer that has an email submission (non-functioning) box as well as other applicable links.
- **Product Grid**: Display a grid of products using the provided data. --Done
- **Filtering**: Add a filter dropdown to filter products by color.
- **Sorting**: Add a sorting dropdown to sort products by price or name.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Explanation**: Provide a brief document explaining your approach, any challenges faced, and trade-offs made.

DAVIDS NOTES:
I wanted to move fast to I used React Materials to accomplish this and broke everthing outside of the products into its own component. I have removed the node modules for easy file transfer so make sure you do npm install before you run npm start 

Best - David
